### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose of the Document

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the 5G Network Monitoring System, an AI-powered solution designed to predict traffic congestion and detect faults in 5G networks. 
It details the system’s architecture, features, operator use cases, deployment strategies, hardware needs, limitations, and potential enhancements, providing a clear roadmap for implementation and operation.


#### 1.2 Project Overview

The 5G Network Monitoring System enhances the reliability and performance of 5G networks by leveraging machine learning, real-time data processing, and external data integrations (e.g., weather, social media).
It is optimized for low-latency environments, making it ideal for telecom operators managing Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) and other critical applications.


### 2. System Architecture

#### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The system employs a modular, microservices-based architecture for scalability and low latency. It operates across edge and cloud environments:
    
    **Edge Layer**: Handles real-time tasks like log ingestion, preprocessing, prediction, and action execution.
    
    **Cloud Layer:** Manages model retraining, federated learning, and operator dashboards.
    
Here’s a flow representation:
    
    **Edge (MEC Servers):** Logs --> Preprocessing --> Prediction --> Action --> Orchestration --> Feedback
    
    **Cloud**: Federated Learning --> Retraining --> Dashboard

#### 2.2 Microservices Breakdown

    The system is composed of distinct microservices:
    
    **Log Ingestion:** Streams real-time logs from gNodeBs using Kafka.
    
    **Preprocessing:** Dynamically maps logs, scales features, and integrates multi-modal data.
    
    **Prediction**: Employs machine learning models for traffic and fault prediction.
    
    **Action**: Uses reinforcement learning to suggest optimized responses.
    
    **Orchestrator**: Automates action execution via network orchestrators (e.g., ONAP).
    
    **Feedback**: Collects operator input for continuous improvement.

#### 2.3 Data Flow and Processing

    **Ingestion**: Logs are collected every 60 seconds from gNodeBs, enriched with external data (e.g., Twitter/X trends).
    
    **Preprocessing**: Logs are standardized, scaled, and fused into a "network health score."
    
    **Prediction**: Models predict traffic and faults with real-time adaptation.
    
    **Action**: Optimized actions are suggested and executed automatically.
    
    **Feedback**: Operator feedback refines the system iteratively.

### 3. Key Features

#### 3.1 Real-Time Traffic Prediction

    **Description**: Uses a quantized LSTM model to forecast downlink traffic up to 10 minutes ahead.
    
    **Example**: During a sports event, the system predicts a traffic surge and recommends bandwidth increases at nearby gNodeBs.

#### 3.2 Fault Detection and Classification

    **Description**: Combines an autoencoder for anomaly detection and Random Forest for fault classification, with SHAP for root cause analysis.
    
    **Example**: Detects a gNodeB fault due to "CPU overload" and suggests maintenance before failure.

#### 3.3 Multi-Modal Data Fusion

    **Description**: Integrates logs, social media, GIS, and weather data via a transformer model to create a network health score.
    
    **Example**: Combines Twitter/X outage reports with logs to predict congestion during a public event.

#### 3.4 Reinforcement Learning for Action Optimization

    **Description**: A DQN agent selects optimal actions based on network state and historical performance.
    
    **Example**: During a storm, it chooses "reroute traffic" over "increase bandwidth" based on past success
.
#### 3.5 Online Learning and Adaptation

    **Description**: Updates models incrementally with real-time data and new metrics.
    
    **Example**: Adapts the LSTM model when a new 3GPP metric (e.g., urllc_latency) appears in logs.

#### 3.6 Automated Action Execution

    **Description**: Executes actions like QoS adjustments via network orchestrators.
    
    **Example**: Automatically boosts bandwidth at a gNodeB upon congestion prediction.

#### 3.7 Security and Compliance
    
    **Description**: Features RBAC, OAuth, AES-256 encryption, and differential privacy.
    
    **Example**: Encrypts logs and restricts dashboard access to authorized personnel, ensuring GDPR compliance.

### 4. Use Cases for Operators

#### 4.1 Managing Event-Driven Traffic Spikes

    **Scenario**: A festival causes a sudden traffic spike.
    
    **Response**: Predicts congestion using social media and logs, increases
    capacity via ONAP, and verifies reduced latency with feedback.
    
    **Benefit**: Maintains service quality during peak demand.

#### 4.2 Proactive Fault Management

    **Scenario**: A gNodeB shows signs of impending failure.
    
    **Response**: Predicts the fault, identifies the cause (e.g., power supply), and recommends maintenance.
    
    **Benefit**: Prevents downtime with early intervention.

#### 4.3 Environmental Impact Handling

    **Scenario**: Fog disrupts signal quality.
    
    **Response**: Uses weather and GIS data to predict degradation, adjusts QoS settings automatically.
    
    **Benefit**: Ensures consistent performance in adverse conditions.

#### 4.4 Ultra-Low-Latency Applications

    **Scenario**: Drones require <100 ms latency.
    
    **Response**: Predicts and mitigates issues within ~50 ms, allocates resources to maintain URLLC.
    
    **Benefit**: Supports critical applications with minimal delay.

### 5. Deployment Methods
